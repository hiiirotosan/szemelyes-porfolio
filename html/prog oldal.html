            <h2 class="cimekh2">The Start</h2>
            <p>I been interested in technology since i was a little kid. I got my first phone when i was 9, i still remember
            that it was a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime with 8gb ROM and 1gb RAM.I also had an old PC where i used to play
            Minecraft and Transformice with my friends.I have fallen in love technology at a young age.</p>

            <h2 class="cimekh2">Building PC-s</h2>
            <p>My Mom got some old used PC-s from her workplace that they no longer needed.
            Since i been watching a lot of PC building i wanted to put my knowledge to the test.
            I dissasambelled the pcs and built one from scratch. With trail and error i have built my first
            PC, installed windows, and wondered: 'that's it?' It was way easier than i tought.</p>

            <h2 class="cimekh2">Interest in programming</h2>
            <p>I played atleast 20 games over the years, and wondered how do people make games?
            I researched a bit and discovered coding. After that i always wanted to be a programmer, more
            specifically a game developer, but sadly this dream never came to reality.</p>
